          <p>Prolific writer, translator, and thinker Giacomo Leopardi was born in the small provincial town of
            Recanati, Italy, during a time of political upheaval and unrest in Europe created by the French Revolution.
            Although his aristocratic family was affected by the instability of the region, Leopardi was tutored
            extensively under private priests from an early age, showing a remarkable talent and thirst for knowledge.
            As a sickly adolescent who was often confined to the household, Leopardi spent most of his time in his
            father’s extraordinary library, immersing himself in classical and philological knowledge. Within years of
            independent study, Leopardi became fluent in reading and writing Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, while he began
            translating various classical texts including Horace and Homer.</p>

          <p class="padding-top50">For years Leopardi secluded himself in his father’s library, studying and writing
            constantly. At the age of
            fourteen he wrote Pompeo in Egitto (Pompey in Egypt) an anti-Caesarean manifesto, and went onto writing
            various philological works until 1816, which marked a turning point in Leopardi’s life which he called “the
            passage from erudition to the beautiful.” Leopardi wrote L'appressamento della morte (The Approach of
            Death), a poem in terza rima which was heavily influenced by Petrarch and Dante, as well as Inno a Nettuno
            (Hymn to Neptune), and Le rimembranze (Memories). After this, Leopardi abandoned other types of work and
            concentrated on lyric poetry, including his book Canti (Songs) and Canzoniere (Songbook), as well as many
            more. Leopardi frequently focuses on the patriotic, idyllic scenes, unrequited love, childhood, and
            classical themes and references.</p>

          <p class="padding-top50">Regarded by many as the “first modern Italian classic” poet, Leopardi was
            additionally praised for his prose work, with his varied use of dialogue, myth, allegory, and satire. For
            over five years years he stopped writing lyric poetry so he could concentrate on composing his innovative
            prose magnum opus called Operette morali (Small Moral Works).</p>
          <p class="padding-top50">Unfortunately, Leopardi spent most of his life with ill health and growing blindness.
            As a result of his medical conditions, he was confined to Recanati for a long period of time but over his
            lifetime was able to travel to Rome, Florence, Milan, Bologna, and Pisa. In 1837, he died, likely from edema
            and other complications, in Naples.</p>
