Yes, if you know the fundamentals of physical movement and arm weight—and it can begin from the first lesson. Scott McBride Smith will share all the secrets.",

Until the second half of the 20th century, this particular repertory, which had been placed under the shadow of the achievements of Beethoven's piano sonatas, had finally acclaimed the high appraisal by pianists as well as historians and critics. This lecture will focus on the lyrical-epic quality of Schubert's 20 piano sonatas, and explain with concrete examples, how this composer, who was a contemporary with Beethoven, tried to create a completely personal style of composing and artistic conception different from the great contemporary in this typical Beethovenian music genre.",

Hand injuries caused by inappropriate practice have even forced some talented pianists to end their career. How can pianists find a pain-free, efficient technique and avoid injury? \nJoin Ivy Wang, learn how to apply the rotation technique to achieve the pain-free practice, help you and your student avoid possible pain from their practice.

    "row3": "In this workshop you will develop those spontaneous elements. Creating through singing, drumming and conducting, outside of the comfort zone of the played instrument, will help us find the creative impulse. Later, we’ll apply what we’ve learned to the keyboard, with different methods and models of free improvisation. Come join us for something different from your usual piano lesson."
