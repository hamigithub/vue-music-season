Until the second half of the 20th century, this particular repertory, which had been placed under the shadow of the achievements of Beethoven's piano sonatas, had finally acclaimed the high appraisal by pianists as well as historians and critics. This lecture will focus on the lyrical-epic quality of Schubert's 20 piano sonatas, and explain with concrete examples, how this composer, who was a contemporary with Beethoven, tried to create a completely personal style of composing and artistic conception different from the great contemporary in this typical Beethovenian music genre.",

Creating through singing, drumming and conducting, outside of the comfort zone of the played instrument, will help us find the creative impulse.
